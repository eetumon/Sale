# Sale (Sauli Niinistö) - The Finnish President
Sale is an open-source Chrome extension that changes all recognizable headers and pictures to the Finnish President Sauli Niinistö. To show our love and appreciation for his efforts during these rough times, creating something like this can only be deemed reasonable and perhaps necessary. 

The headers and images can be changed by digging deeper into the code. This project is a "learning project" for me and my coding knowledge. Original inspiration came from a video on TikTok whose account I can't recall as of now. Credits there though if you recognize yourself from this! ;)
